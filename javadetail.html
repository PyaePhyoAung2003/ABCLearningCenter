      <p style="font-size: 20px;">The Java is one of the most widely used computer programming languages for building web applications. It enables many programmers to write codes using more effective instruction sets supplied by Struts are the most popular frame for creating Java-based web software. Struts have been developed as an open-source endeavor initiated by Apache Software Foundation. Struts framework is based on the Model View Controller (MVC) architecture. This frame functions as a bridge between the program's Model and the net View. When a petition is received, the Controller invokes an Action class. The Action class consults using the Model to test or update the program's state.</p>

      <h4 style="text-align: center;">Spring Framework</h4>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        <br>
        The Spring Framework is an open-source Java application framework which uses inversion of control(IoC) containers to the Java platform. The frameworks can be used by any Java application, but there are numerous extensions for building rich UI web applications on top of the Java EE platform. It became popular in the Java community as an alternative to, a replacement for, or also to the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) version. The most preffered Spring Framework mainly consists of inversion of control(IoC), Aspect-oriented programming (AOP), Data Access (DA), Transaction Management (TM), Model View Controller (MVC).</p>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;">Hibernate</h4>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Hibernate is an open-source ORM (object-relational mapping) instrument for the Java programming language is the key alternative framework JDBC. This framework provides the mapping of an object-oriented domain model into a hierarchical database. Hibernate overcomes these shortcomings and builds are the better sources. This frame primary attribute is mapping from Java classes to database tables and mapping from Java data types to SQL and No-SQL database kinds. This also provides data query and retrieval facilities. It creates SQL calls and relieves the developer from the manual handling and conversion of the result collection.</p>
        <br>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;">Strings</h4>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Strings in Java are simply objects that represent a succession of char values and are comparable to arrays of characters that behave similarly to Java strings. Java programming enables the “String class,” which allows you to construct and modify strings in real time. Strings are commonly used in Java-based software and may also function as objects. A String may be created in two different ways, the first is by using double quotation marks, and the second is by creating a new object. It is also possible to generate an empty String by keeping the parenthesis blank or by eliminating characters inside the double quotation marks. We created a Strings curriculum in the Java programming language for individuals who want to specialize.
          <br><br>
          Java is now in high demand in the software development area across the world. Our Java Classes in ABC Learning Center is an excellent resource for learning the fundamentals of strings and developing applications with them.
